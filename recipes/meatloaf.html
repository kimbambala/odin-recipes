<h2>Description</h2>
    <P>Meatloaf is a dish of ground meat that has been combined with other ingredients and 
    formed into the shape of a loaf, then baked or smoked. The final shape is either hand-formed 
    on a baking tray, or pan-formed by cooking it in a loaf pan.[1] It is usually made with ground beef, 
    although ground lamb, pork, veal, venison, poultry and seafood are also used, sometimes in combination. 
    Vegetarian adaptations of meatloaf may use imitation meat or pulses. </P>
    
   <p>The cooked meatloaf can be sliced like a loaf of bread to make individual portions. It can easily 
    become dry; therefore, various techniques exist to keep the dish moist, like mixing in bread 
    crumbs and egg, covering it with sauce, wrapping it, or using moisture-enhancing ingredients in 
    the mixture, such as filling it with fatty meats, rich cheeses, or vegetables. </p>
